# BattleShip
This is a sample battleship game demonstrating the implementation of classes in OOP as a part of the Python programming language. The project is essentially a fully functional 2 player game of battleship. It is designed to be played by 2 human players, and moves can be made by setting coordinates to place ships and decide upon firing locations. The board size must be set and will accommodate a nontraditional playing field.
## Motivations
This simple project was built as my first programming assignment, that has since been edited to have a faster run time.
